# My-Project
This project is a web-based application designed to help students, especially visually impaired users, to take online exams easily using voice commands.

In this system, users can register, login, listen to questions through Text-to-Speech, and answer using Speech-to-Text.
The system automatically stores their answers in the database and evaluates the result.

The main objective of this project is to make online exams more accessible, user-friendly, and inclusive for everyone.”
